				<p> I started out my sales career in ecommerce before moving to a hardware support focused role. Currently, I am the sole relationship owner in Ireland for the sale of non-IBM support. I work with large Commercial & Government organisations helping them to improve their IT infrastructure by reducing complexity, decreasing costs and ensuring availability of systems. </p>

				<p>This means developing and implementing tailored integrated IT multivendor service solutions to increase the value obtained from data centre environments. As my role & responsibilities have increased, so too has my requirement to become more knowledgeable in the field of software as this is becoming an increasingly important topic within the industry. </p>

				<p>Funnily enough, this knowledge gap has inspired something within me that I’ve had since childhood. As a kid, I discovered the power of creating websites by way of HTML using Notepad. I thought this was magic. Then along came website scripts and ‘Flash’ scripting – what are others doing but more importantly, how are they doing it and how can I improve on it.</p>

				<p>Somewhere along the line, I had to “concentrate on schoolwork”, stopped improving and ultimately forgot about the joy of (simple) programming. In 2020, as part of a promotion effort, I came up with the idea & created a simple to help save time & upskill newcomers and just like that, my love for programming was reawakened.</p>

				<p>I have many ideas but have never been able to implement them due to a lack of skill. This course will enable me to put those ideas into reality and also be a massive factor when it comes to my credibility in my current career path. I do not know if I will make the full switch to a web or software developer upon completion of this course, but it is something I am seriously contemplating and look to seeing which way I want to go with it / it wants to bring me.</p>
